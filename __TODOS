CURRENTLY:
	+ Create TransformationHash
	+ Create ModelRunner

PRIORITY 1:
	+ Create Statistics Database
	+ Create canonical dates functions to make sure dates line ups	

PRIORITY 2:
	+ In DatabaseInstructions, combine generate statement fns with actual fns
		? Separated initially for testing purposes?
	+ Create Testing Library for common functions (e.g. createTestDB)
		+ Migrate over testing library from other library
	+ Consider changing transformations from set of three to unbounded list
	+ Add to list of transformations
	+ Add to list of categorizations
	+ Add complexity scores to models (idea of how long they run, for budgeting)

PRIORITY 3:
	+ Define program in packages
	+ Change all <for i in range()> to <for i in xrange()>
	+ Implement cython where appropriate
		+ datatree impurity calculations
		+ most BCM calculations
	+ Need a comprehensive Error Strategy
		+ Define specific errors
		? Who's raising errors where? See Database select/retrieval statements for example
	+ Need a comprehensive Logging Strategy
		+ Log Channeling (i.e. separate db debugging)

INDIVIDUAL FILES:

EMF_DataSeriesHandle:
#	Should we save data history internally (save DB retrieval, like in wordHistory)
#	Implement multiple row insertion
#	save maxDateEncountered, minDateEncountered, etc.
#	we insert but we don't retrieve isInterpolated, isForecast
#	Find a way to make sure that data history date/times match up (create canonical dates fn)

_test_EMF_DataSeriesHandle:
#	Make cleaner
#	Test __getFromDB/__sendToDB

EMF_WordSeriesHandle:
#	Implement multiple row insertion
#	save maxDateEncountered, minDateEncountered, etc.
#	Find a way to make sure that word history date/times match up (create canonical dates fn)

util_EMF:
#	Remove Main
