CURRENTLY:
	+ Create canonical dates functions to make sure dates line up
	+ Create Interpolator
		+ Interpolate using last known value
		+ Interpolate linearly
		+ Interpolate using PCE/other matrix factorization methods
	+ Create 2D Map with Descriptors

PRIORITY 1:
	+ Data Download
		+ How do we make sure dates are end of month/line up?
	+ Non-Random Model Selection
		+ Model Evaluator
			+ Correlation
			+ ANOVA Stats
			+ PCE Comparison?
	+ Model Description
		+ Transformation Pattern Description
			+ Transformations and Categorizations return values
			+ Functions
		+ Word Description
		+ Data Description
			+ Need Metadata Tree? (i.e. define geographies/subgeographies, sectors/subsectors)
	+ Implement Test/Training Sampling
		+ Implement bootstrapping
	+ Implement Pre-processing (normalization/de-normalization)

PRIORITY 2:
	+ Migrate over testing library from other library
	+ Consider changing transformations from set of three to unbounded list
	+ Add to list of transformations
		+ Above Average
		+ High Volatility
	+ Add to list of categorizations
	+ Add complexity scores to models (idea of how long they run, for budgeting)

PRIORITY 3:
	+ Define program in packages
	+ Need a comprehensive Error Strategy
		+ Define specific errors
	+ Need a comprehensive Logging Strategy
		+ Log Channeling (i.e. separate db debugging)

PRIORITY 4:
	+ Remove assert statements


LONG-TERM:
	+ Implement Theoretical Inputter (i.e. how do we put in fall in china growth -> high oil prices)

inverted yield curve -> expected recession
rising yield curve -> expected stability
P/E above average -> market returns over next 5 years
interest rates -> market returns over short term

geopolitical worries
troubles in chinese markets


Rising USD -> Low manufacturing employment
Low Oil Price -> Low manufacturing employment
Quantitative Easing (Probably needs to be broken down) -> low bond yields
Low inflation -> low bond yields
Low expected volatility of inflation -> low bond yields
Low commodity prices -> low bond yields
Low bond yields -> less investor demand for bonds


DATA HANDLE:
	+ (Easy) Make it so data series can take series ID, as well as name and ticker 


TIME HANDLE:
	+ Time Handle can read data and figure out its own periodicity/range
	+ Time Handle doesn't have to be end of month 
	+ Time Handle only holds one type of data (e.g. datetime object or epoch)


MODEL HANDLE:
	+ Make it take Serial Handle Template Again
	+ Make it take Model Template Again

RESULTS HANDLE:
	+ Make sure when you lead metadata and pickle, that same models are represented in both.
